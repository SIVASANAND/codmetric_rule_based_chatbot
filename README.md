# 🤖 CodmetricBot – Rule-Based Chatbot (Tkinter GUI)

This is a simple yet powerful **rule-based chatbot** built using **Python** and **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI).  
It was developed as part of my **Codmetric AI Internship Project**, focusing on chatbot design, interactivity, and GUI development.
